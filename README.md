The repository stores some code while I and my two teammate took part in kaggle data mining competition.
- The competition is about pictures multi-classification. There will be 50G+ train data and 20G+ test data of commodities as well as a form of commodity label. We should train a model to try to assign every pictures into a category.
- We used 50-layer resnet. 
- Complete code is in the resnet folder.
